# Database-Management-System-Project
Invention Management 

Problem Statement:
    A database is made to store the invention details like the name of the invention, inventors(s), category(like science, engineering etc), the year of invention, the story behind, awards/recognitions received, the year in which that was received etc. The inventors’ details include name, country, and job type. Example, the chewing gum was invented by an accountant. An invention can get many awards. A database is maintained to store details about the different awards that exist world-wide in each category. Awards can also receive nominations for which the jury’s verdict is final. The list of jury members can also be maintained. Design a database system for the inventors application to maintain all the data conveniently and efficiently.
    
Description and approach followed:
  As the problem statement describes the problem well the approach followed to solve this problem is as follows
The Project is divided 3 phases

Phase 1:
   In this phase the system was developed from the results of Entity relation and Schema model
   The drawbacks of this model are recorded for further development
  
Phase 2:
  In this phase the system was developed from the results of Normalization
  The mistakes and issues were recorded
 
Phase 3:
  This is the final phase of the project and the mistakes from both phases are rectified to the maximum extent. 
  The results after correction from both the models are compared here.
